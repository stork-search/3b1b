[INTRO MUSIC]

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,940
Hey everyone, Grant here. This is the first video in a series on the essence of calculus.

3
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,700
and I'll be publishing the following videos once per day for the next 10 days.

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,120
The goal here, as the name suggests, is to really get the heart of the subject out

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,640
in one binge watchable set. But with a topic that's as broad as calculus.

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,120
there's a lot of things that can mean. So, here's what I've in my mind specifically.

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,440
Calculus has a lot of rules and formulas which are often presented as

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,760
things to be memorised.

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,380
Lots of derivative formulas, the product rule, the chain rule, implicit differentiation,

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,380
the fact that integrals and derivatives are opposite, Taylor

11
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,240
series; just a lot of things like that.

12
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,520
And my goal is for you to come away

13
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,030
feeling like you could have invented

14
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,700
calculus yourself. That is, cover all

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,770
those core ideas, but in a way that makes

16
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,660
clear where they actually come from and

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,579
what they really mean using an

18
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:07,280
all-around visual approach. Inventing

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,229
math is no joke, and there is a

20
00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:10,760
difference between being told why

21
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,220
something's true and actually generating

22
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,620
it from scratch. But at all points I want

23
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,540
you to think to yourself if you were an

24
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,500
early mathematician, pondering these

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,640
ideas and drawing out the right diagrams,

26
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,840
does it feel reasonable that you could

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,240
have stumbled across these truths yourself?

28
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,080
In this initial video, I want to

29
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,840
show how you might stumble into the core

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,560
ideas of calculus by thinking very

31
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,700
deeply about one specific bit of

32
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,000
geometry: the area of a circle. Maybe you

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,530
know that this is pi times its radius

34
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,290
squared, but why? Is there a nice way to

35
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,380
think about where this formula comes from?

36
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,119
Well, contemplating this problem and

37
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,070
leaving yourself open to exploring the

38
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,229
interesting thoughts that come about can

39
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,909
actually lead you to a glimpse of three

40
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:55,190
big ideas in calculus: integrals,

41
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,780
derivatives, and the fact that they're opposites.

42
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,000
But the story starts more simply -- just

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,840
you and a circle; let's say with radius three.

44
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,840
You're trying to figure out its

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,729
area, and after going through a lot of

46
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,800
paper trying different ways to chop up

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,569
and rearrange the pieces of that area,

48
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,600
many of which might lead to their own

49
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,120
interesting observations, maybe you try

50
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,160
out the idea of slicing up the circle

51
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,400
into many concentric rings. This should

52
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,270
seem promising because it respects the

53
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,610
symmetry of the circle, and math has a

54
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,650
tendency to reward you when you respect

55
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,989
its symmetries. Let's take one of those

56
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:33,360
rings which has some inner radius R

57
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,220
that's between 0 and 3.

58
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,200
If we can find a nice

59
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,880
expression for the area of each

60
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,800
ring like this one, and if we have a nice

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,900
way to add them all up, it might lead us

62
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,500
to an understanding of the full circle's area.

63
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,660
Maybe you start by imagining

64
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,440
straightening out this ring.

65
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,580
And you could try thinking through

66
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,680
exactly what this new shape is and what

67
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,879
its area should be, but for simplicity

68
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,219
let's just approximate it as a rectangle.

69
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,500
The width of that rectangle is the

70
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,480
circumference of the original ring, which

71
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,359
is two pi times R. Right? I mean that's

72
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:09,030
essentially the definition of pi; and its

73
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,670
thickness? Well that depends on how

74
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,500
finely you chopped up the circle in the

75
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,720
first place, which was kind of arbitrary.

76
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,819
In the spirit of using what will come to

77
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,040
be standard calculus notation, let's call

78
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,580
that thickness dr, for a tiny difference

79
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,930
in the radius from one ring to the next.

80
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,800
Maybe you think of it as something like 0.1.

81
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,860
So, approximating this unwrapped ring

82
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,840
as a thin rectangle, its area is 2 pi

83
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,750
times R, the radius, times dr, the

84
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,299
little thickness. And even though that's

85
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,250
not perfect, for smaller and smaller

86
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,860
choices of dr, this is actually going to

87
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,060
be a better and better approximation for

88
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,299
that area, since the top and the bottom

89
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:49,859
sides of this shape are going to get

90
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,860
closer and closer to being exactly the

91
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,720
same length. So let's just move forward

92
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,640
with this approximation, keeping in the

93
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,200
back of our minds that it's slightly

94
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,030
wrong, but it's going to become more

95
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,940
accurate for smaller and smaller choices

96
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,859
of dr. That is, if we slice up the circle

97
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:08,099
into thinner and thinner rings. So just

98
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,959
to sum up where we are, you've broken up

99
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,080
the area of the circle into all of these

100
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,400
rings, and you're approximating the area

101
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,250
of each one of those as two pi times its

102
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,220
radius times dr, where the specific

103
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,500
value for that inner radius ranges from

104
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,860
zero, for the smallest ring, up to just

105
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,180
under three, for the biggest ring, spaced

106
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,100
out by whatever the thickness is that you

107
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,140
choose for dr—something like 0.1.

108
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,380
And notice that the spacing

109
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,449
between the values here corresponds to

110
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:39,000
the thickness dr of each ring, the

111
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,800
difference in radius from one ring to

112
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,520
the next. In fact, a nice way to think

113
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,360
about the rectangles approximating each

114
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,669
ring's area is to fit them all up-right

115
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:51,060
side by side along this axis. Each one

116
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,190
has a thickness dr, which is why they

117
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,280
fit so snugly right there together, and

118
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,780
the height of any one of these

119
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,760
rectangles sitting above some specific

120
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,240
value of R—like 0.6—is

121
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,400
exactly 2 pi times

122
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,160
that value. That's the circumference of the

123
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,449
corresponding ring that this rectangle approximates. Pictures like this two pi R

124
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:11,979
can actually get kind of tall for the

125
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,319
screen. I mean 2 times pi times 3

126
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,050
is around 19, so let's just throw

127
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,819
up a y-axis that's scaled a little

128
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,590
differently, so that we can actually fit

129
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,340
all of these rectangles on the screen.

130
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,020
A nice way to think about this setup is to

131
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,669
draw the graph of two pi r which is a

132
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:29,500
straight line that has a slope two pi.

133
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,020
Each of these rectangles extends up to

134
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,680
the point where it just barely touches that graph.

135
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,560
Again we're being approximate here.

136
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,080
Each of these rectangles only

137
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,620
approximates the area of the

138
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,030
corresponding ring from the circle, but

139
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,340
remember, that approximation, 2 pi R

140
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,370
times dr, gets less and less wrong as

141
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,780
the size of dr gets smaller and smaller.

142
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,520
And this has a very beautiful meaning

143
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,909
when we're looking at the sum of the

144
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:56,680
areas of all those rectangles.

145
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,710
For smaller and smaller choices of dr, you

146
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,120
might at first think that that turns the

147
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,250
problem into a monstrously large sum.

148
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,980
I mean there's many many rectangles to

149
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,780
consider and the decimal precision of

150
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,259
each one of their areas is going to be

151
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:11,409
an absolute nightmare! But notice; all of

152
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:13,719
their areas in aggregate just looks like

153
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:16,509
the area under a graph, and that portion

154
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,600
under the graph is just a triangle.

155
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,740
A  triangle with a base of 3 and a height

156
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,460
that's 2 pi times 3. So its area, 1/2

157
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:27,490
base times height, works out to be

158
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,900
exactly pi times 3 squared; or if the

159
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,969
radius of our original circle was some

160
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:36,520
other value capital R that area comes

161
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,600
out to be pi times R squared, and that's

162
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,620
the formula for the area of a circle!

163
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,700
It doesn't matter who you are or what you

164
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,060
typically think of math that right there

165
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,960
is a beautiful argument.

166
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,660
But if you want to think like a

167
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:52,779
mathematician here,

168
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,610
you don't just care about finding the

169
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,039
answer; you care about developing general

170
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,100
problem-solving tools and techniques.

171
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,420
So take a moment to meditate on

172
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,480
what exactly just happened and why it worked,

173
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,620
cause the way that we transitioned

174
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,330
from something approximate to something

175
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,669
precise is actually pretty subtle, and it

176
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:11,740
cuts deep to what calculus is all about.

177
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,580
You had this problem that can be

178
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,660
approximated with the sum of many small

179
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,960
numbers, each of which looked like 2 pi R

180
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,680
times dr for values of R ranging

181
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,180
between 0 and 3.

182
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,420
Remember, the small number dr here

183
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,400
represents our choice for the thickness

184
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,740
of each ring—for example 0.1. And there

185
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,480
are two important things to note here.

186
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,680
First of all, not only is dr a factor in

187
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,610
the quantities we're adding up—2 pi R

188
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,400
times dr—it also gives the spacing

189
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,639
between the different values of R.

190
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,820
And secondly, the smaller our choice for dr

191
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,720
the better the approximation.

192
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,840
Adding all of those numbers could be seen in a

193
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,820
different pretty clever way as adding

194
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,130
the areas of many thin rectangles

195
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,560
sitting underneath a graph. The graph of

196
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,660
the function 2 pi R in this case.

197
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,100
Then—and this is key—by considering smaller

198
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,720
and smaller choices for dr corresponding

199
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,919
to better and better approximations of the original problem, this sum, thought

200
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:14,990
of as the aggregate area of those

201
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,750
rectangles, approaches the area under the

202
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,240
graph; and because of that, you can

203
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,070
conclude that the answer to the original

204
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,240
question in full un-approximated

205
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,040
precision is exactly the same as the

206
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,860
area underneath this graph.

207
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,320
A lot of other hard problems in math and

208
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,260
science can be broken down and

209
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,640
approximated as the sum of many small

210
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,279
quantities. Things like figuring out how

211
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,349
far a car has traveled based on its

212
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:44,990
velocity at each point in time. In a case

213
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,600
like that you might range through many

214
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,800
different points in time and at each one

215
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,560
multiply the velocity at that time times

216
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,529
a tiny change in time, dt, which would

217
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:55,880
give the corresponding little bit of

218
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,740
distance traveled during that little

219
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,120
time. I'll talk through the details of

220
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,200
examples like this later in the series,

221
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,000
but at a high level many of these types

222
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,220
of problems turn out to be equivalent to

223
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,520
finding the area under some graph.

224
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,480
In  much the same way that our circle

225
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,150
problem did. This happens whenever the

226
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,589
quantities that you're adding up,

227
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:17,690
the one whose sum approximates the

228
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,820
original problem, can be thought of as

229
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,010
the areas of many thin rectangles

230
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,760
sitting side-by-side like this.

231
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,440
If finer and finer approximations of the

232
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,480
original problem correspond to thinner

233
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,730
and thinner rings, then the original

234
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,560
problem is going to be equivalent to

235
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,720
finding the area under some graph.

236
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,800
Again, this is an idea we'll see in more detail

237
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,120
later in the series, so don't worry if

238
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,010
it's not 100% clear right now.

239
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,920
The point now is that you, as the

240
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,750
mathematician having just solved a

241
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,550
problem by reframing it as the area

242
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,250
under a graph, might start thinking about

243
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,320
how to find the areas under other graphs.

244
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,020
I mean we were lucky in the circle

245
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,670
problem that the relevant area turned

246
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,770
out to be a triangle. But imagine instead

247
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,410
something like a parabola, the graph of x

248
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,350
squared. What's the area underneath that

249
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,140
curve say between the values of x equals

250
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,310
zero and x equals 3? Well, it's hard

251
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,010
to think about, right? And let me reframe

252
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,810
that question in a slightly different way:

253
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,480
we'll fix that left endpoint in place at

254
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,420
zero and let the right endpoint vary.

255
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,240
Are you able to find a function A(x)

256
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:31,569
that gives you the area under this

257
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:36,279
parabola between 0 and x? A function

258
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:38,799
A(x) like this is called an integral of

259
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,559
x-squared. Calculus holds within it the

260
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,479
tools to figure out what an integral

261
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:46,029
like this is, but right now it's just a

262
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:48,129
mystery function to us. We know it gives

263
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:50,079
the area under the graph of x squared

264
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,179
between some fixed left point and some

265
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:54,069
variable right point, but we don't know

266
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:57,129
what it is. And again, the reason we care

267
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:59,019
about this kind of question is not just

268
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:01,179
for the sake of asking hard geometry

269
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:03,759
questions; it's because many practical

270
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,589
problems that can be approximated by

271
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:07,779
adding up a large number of small things

272
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:10,539
can be reframed as a question about an

273
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:14,049
area under a certain graph. And I'll tell

274
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,639
you right now that finding this area

275
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:18,579
this integral function, is genuinely hard

276
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:21,220
and whenever you come across a genuinely

277
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,769
hard question in math a good policy is

278
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:25,809
to not try too hard to get at the answer

279
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:28,029
directly, since usually you just end up

280
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:29,560
banging your head against a wall.

281
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,439
Instead, play around with the idea, with no

282
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:34,839
particular goal in mind. Spend some time

283
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:36,489
building up familiarity with the

284
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:38,470
interplay between the function defining

285
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,139
the graph, in this case x squared, and the

286
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,660
function giving the area.

287
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,060
In that playful spirit if you're lucky

288
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,940
here's something that you might notice

289
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,900
When you slightly increase x by some

290
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,990
tiny nudge dx look at the resulting

291
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,240
change in area represented with this

292
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,940
sliver that I'm going to call dA for a

293
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,510
tiny difference in area. That sliver can

294
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,010
be pretty well approximated with a

295
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,590
rectangle one whose height is x squared

296
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,190
and whose width is dx, and the smaller

297
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,070
the size of that nudge dx the more that

298
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,300
sliver actually looks like a rectangle.

299
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,440
Now this gives us an interesting way to

300
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,550
think about how A(x) is related to

301
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,580
x-squared. A change to the output of A,

302
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,580
this little dA, is about equal to x

303
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,770
squared, where X is whatever input you

304
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,990
started at, times dx,

305
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,880
the little nudge to the input that

306
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,240
caused A to change. Or rearranged dA

307
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,660
divided by dx, the ratio of a tiny change

308
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,600
in A to the tiny change in x that caused it, is approximately whatever x squared

309
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,920
is at that point, and that's an

310
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,570
approximation that should get better and

311
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,400
better for smaller and smaller choices

312
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,610
of dx. In other words, we don't know what

313
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,400
A(x) is; that remains a mystery, but we

314
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,440
do know a property that this mystery

315
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,990
function must have. When you look at two

316
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,410
nearby points for example 3 &amp; 3.001

317
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,710
consider the change to the output of A

318
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,230
between those two points—the difference

319
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,390
between the mystery function evaluated

320
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,890
at 3.001 and evaluated at 3. That change

321
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,990
divided by the difference in the input

322
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,050
values, which in this case is 0.001,

323
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,750
should be about equal to the value of x

324
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,970
squared for the starting input—in this

325
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,440
case 3 squared.

326
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,340
And this relationship between tiny

327
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,450
changes to the mystery function and the

328
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,880
values of x-squared itself is true at

329
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,850
all inputs not just 3. That doesn't

330
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,860
immediately tell us how to find A(x),

331
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,990
but it provides a very strong clue that

332
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,060
we can work with.

333
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,620
and there's nothing special about the

334
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:49,910
graph x squared here. Any function

335
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,459
defined as the area under some graph has

336
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,060
this property that dA divided by

337
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,459
dx—a slight nudge to the output of A divided

338
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:00,079
by a slight nudge to the input that

339
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,629
caused it—is about equal to the height

340
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:04,500
of the graph at that point.

341
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,260
Again, that's an approximation that gets better and

342
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,560
better for smaller choices of dx.

343
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,939
And here, we're stumbling into another big

344
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:17,149
idea from calculus: "Derivatives". This

345
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,089
ratio dA divided by dx is called the

346
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:23,119
derivative of A, or more technically the

347
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:24,470
derivative is whatever this ratio

348
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,760
approaches as dx gets smaller and

349
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,449
smaller. Although, I dive much more deeply

350
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:30,980
into the idea of a derivative in the

351
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,499
next video, but loosely speaking it's a

352
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:35,509
measure of how sensitive a function is

353
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:38,239
to small changes in its input. You'll see

354
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:39,860
as the series goes on that there are

355
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,899
many many ways that you can visualize a

356
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,740
derivative depending on what function

357
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,959
you're looking at and how you think

358
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,940
about tiny nudges to its output.

359
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,750
And we care about derivatives because

360
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,940
they help us solve problems, and in our

361
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,949
little exploration here, we already have

362
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:56,660
a slight glimpse of one way that they're

363
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,029
used. They are the key to solving

364
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:01,339
integral questions, problems that require

365
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,560
finding the area under a curve.

366
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,440
Once you gain enough familiarity with computing

367
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,449
derivatives, you'll be able to look at a

368
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,430
situation like this one where you don't

369
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,410
know what a function is but you do know

370
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,970
that its derivative should be x squared

371
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,269
and from that reverse engineer what the

372
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:21,529
function must be. And this back and forth

373
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:24,230
between integrals and derivatives where

374
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,819
the derivative of a function for the

375
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:28,459
area under a graph gives you back the

376
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:30,310
function defining the graph itself is

377
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,620
called the "Fundamental theorem of

378
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,440
calculus". It ties together the two big

379
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,819
ideas of integrals and derivatives, and

380
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:40,910
it shows how, in some sense, each one is

381
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,520
an inverse of the other.

382
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,699
All of this is only a high-level view:

383
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:48,709
just a peek at some of the core ideas

384
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:51,019
that emerge in calculus, and what follows

385
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:52,699
in the series are the details for

386
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,760
derivatives and integrals and more.

387
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,050
At all points I want you to feel that you

388
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,280
could have invented calculus yourself.

389
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,240
That if you drew the right pictures and

390
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,899
played with each idea in just the right

391
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:05,240
way, these formulas and rules and

392
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,190
constructs that are presented could have

393
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,019
just as easily popped out naturally from

394
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:13,339
your own explorations, and before you go

395
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,899
it would feel wrong not to give the

396
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:16,370
people who supported this series on

397
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,920
Patreon a well-deserved thanks both for

398
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,839
their financial backing as well as for

399
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,639
the suggestions they gave while the

400
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,870
series was being developed.

401
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,389
You see supporters got early access to

402
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:28,310
the videos as I made them, and they'll

403
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,139
continue to get early access for future

404
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:32,870
essence of type series and as a thanks

405
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,649
to the community

406
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:35,600
I keep ads off of new videos for their

407
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,209
first month. I'm still astounded that I

408
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:39,889
can spend time working on videos like

409
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:42,680
these, and in a very direct way you are

410
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,430
the one to thank for that.
